# Skills Learned
As it was my first proper frontend project (meant for learning), I learned react basics along the way, learned to implement useState, useCallback and other hooks react provides. It was great learning Experience to have while building.

# To DOs
I want to Implement Backend, in this project. Using Express.js(for routing) and MongoDB(for Database management).

Maybe Add User Logins and Personalized Themes, and also some support for Video Games using some Video Games Database.

And Deploy it on vercel where others can interact.
